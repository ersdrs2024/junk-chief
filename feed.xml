<section>
<p data-id="n3at_0_textid-text1" id="n3at_0_textid-text1">We guarantee that your Credit Card transactions are safe and secure. You do not have to be concerned. We also guarantee the safety of any information you provide us.<br />
<br />
<strong>Your Safety and Security are Important To Us</strong><br />
<br />
What will you do with my personal information?<br />
We are very concerned about how other websites use our personal information (name, e-mail address, preferences, etc.). The owner of Junk Chief is committed to your privacy. As a result, we will always make sure that any information you elect to provide us is kept confidential. We pledge that we will never provide that information to anyone else.<br />
<br />
We only use your e-mail address and any other information you elect to provide us to better serve you and keep you informed about changes in our site, party and rental ideas and suggestions, new products, and special pricing only available to our customers and newsletter members. You can rest assured that your information is safe with us. We look forward to serving you.<br />

<strong>Official Privacy Policy Statement:</strong><br />
<br />
This is the website of <a href="http://www.JunkChiefNJ.com">www.JunkChiefNJ.com</a><br />
Our postal address is<br />
1506 Beaver Dam Rd #9<br />
Point Pleasant, NJ 08742<br />
We can be reached via e-mail at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a3e9d6cdc8c0cbcac6c5cdc9e3c4cec2cacf8dc0ccce">[email&#160;protected]</a><br />
or you can reach us by telephone at (732) 714-5000<br />
<br />
For each visitor to our webpage, our web server does not collect information regarding your domain or e-mail address. We do not collect information on consumers who browse our web page. With respect to cookies, we use cookies to store visitors&#39; preferences and record session information, such as items that our customers add to their shopping cart.<br />
<br />
If you supply us with your postal address or telephone numbers online during your order, you will only receive postal or telephone contact from us with information regarding orders you have placed online.<br />
<br />
With respect to security, we always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our site. We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site.<br />
<br />
If you feel this site is not following its stated information policy, you may contact us at the above addresses or phone numbers. The Federal Trade Commission by phone at 202-FTC-HELP (202-382-4357) or electronically at <a href="https://rn.ftc.gov/pls/dod/wsolcq$.startup?Z_ORG_CODE=PU01">https://rn.ftc.gov/pls/dod/wsolcq$.startup?Z_ORG_CODE=PU01</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Is it really safe for me to use my credit card?</strong><br />
<br />
Yes, it is. Shopping at <a href="http://www.JunkChiefNJ.com">www.JunkChiefNJ.com</a> is extremely safe. We guarantee you 100% safety when you use your credit card with us. You must be on our secure server software on a completely separate compartment of our system, and your computer must accept cookies, or you will be unable to order. That way we are able to guarantee your credit card purchase. You will never have to pay for any unauthorized charges made to your card as a result of shopping with us at www.JunkChiefNJ.com<br />
<br />
<strong>What makes it so safe?</strong><br />
<br />
Technology is secure and stable: The software we use in the order compartment of our system (SSL) is the standard for this industry. All of the major browsers support it and promote how well it works on their websites and in their software. The software takes the data that you provide and encrypts it in a special coding system that can only be interpreted by our system in our office. This system is actually safer than giving it out over the telephone or sending a fax.<br />
<br />
All the big guys are using the same software: Companies like Amazon.com, AT&amp;T, Dell Computers, etc. are using the same software. They have millions of customers who safely shop without experiencing credit card fraud. Since we started, we have had thousands of customers order without any credit card fraud at all. You can feel comfortable that the same precautions are being taken at the big companies to ensure your card&#39;s safety.<br />
<br />
<strong>Still rather not use your card on the internet?</strong><br />
<br />
That&#39;s fine. You are welcome to print your order and fax it to us with your payment information.<br />
Or mail it to us at:<br />
Junk Chief<br />
1506 Beaver Dam Rd #9<br />
Point Pleasant, NJ 08742<br />
<br />
Remember to include your credit card information, check or money order in the envelope. (Just cut-n-paste this address into your word processor and make a label for your envelope.)<br />
Or call in your order to (732) 714-5000<br />
<br />
<strong>Credit Card Guarantee</strong><br />
<br />
Based on the Fair Credit Billing Act passed by the U.S. Congress, your bank is not allowed to hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank should decide to exercise its right to hold you liable for that $50.00, Junk Chief will reimburse you for that amount, up to the full $50.00. www.JunkChiefNJ.com will only cover your liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card was caused by no fault of your own from purchases made with www.JunkChiefNJ.com while using our SSL secure server.<br />
In the event that you suffer a loss due to unauthorized use of the credit card, according to law, you must notify your credit card company immediately based on the reporting rules and procedures that they have provided you.<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Refunds and Returns Policy: No refunds will be given once a reservation is completed and paid for.</strong></em></p>
